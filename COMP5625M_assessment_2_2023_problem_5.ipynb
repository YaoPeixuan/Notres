        "Through this assessment, you will:\n",
        "\n",
        "> 1. Understand the principles of text pre-processing and vocabulary building.\n",
        "> 2. Gain experience working with an image-to-text model.\n",
        "> 3. Use and compare two text similarity metrics for evaluating an image-to-text model, and understand evaluation challenges.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Setup and resources \n",
        "\n",
        "Having a GPU will speed up the image feature extraction process. If you want to use a GPU, please refer to the module website for recommended working environments with GPUs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Please implement the coursework using PyTorch and Python-based libraries, and refer to the notebooks and exercises provided.\n",
        "\n",
        "This assessment will use a subset of the [COCO \"Common Objects in Context\" dataset](https://cocodataset.org/) for image caption generation. COCO contains 330K images of 80 object categories, and at least five textual reference captions per image. Our subset consists of nearly 5070 of these images, each with five or more different descriptions of the salient entities and activities, and we will refer to it as COCO_5070.\n",

        "To download the data:\n",
        "\n",
        "> 1. **Images and annotations**: download the zipped file provided in the link here as [``COMP5625M_data_assessment_2.zip``](https://leeds365-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/scssali_leeds_ac_uk/EWWzE-_AIrlOkvOKxH4rjIgBF_eUx8KDJMPKM2eHwCE0dg?e=DdX62H). \n",
        "\n",
        "``Info only:`` To understand more about the COCO dataset, you can look at the [download page](https://cocodataset.org/#download). We have already provided you with the \"2017 Train/Val annotations (241MB)\", but our image subset consists of fewer images than the original COCO dataset. **So, no need to download anything from here!** \n",
        "\n",
        "> 2. **Image metadata**: as our set is a subset of the full COCO dataset, we have created a CSV file containing relevant metadata for our particular subset of images. You can also download it from Drive, \"coco_subset_meta.csv\", at the same link as 1.\n",

This pretrained network has been trained on the complete ImageNet dataset and is thus able to recognise common objects. \n",

One way to do this is use the \"FasterRCNN_ResNet50_FPN_V2_Weights.COCO_V1\" but use e.g., \"resnet_model = model.backbone.body\". Alternatively, you can use the checkpoint from your previous coursework where you finetuned to COCO dataset. \n",
